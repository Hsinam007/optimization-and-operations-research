# Learning of Optimization and Operations Research

This repository documents my structured learning of optimization and operations research concepts, implemented using Python.

The objective of this repository is to build a strong foundation in optimization techniques by combining mathematical formulation with computational implementation and visualization.

## Topics Covered
- Linear Programming
  - Graphical Method
  - Simplex Method (using Python)
- Transportation Problem
- Assignment Problem
- Integer Programming (planned)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PuLP

## Structure of the Repository
Each topic is organized in a separate folder containing:
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with code, explanations, and outputs
- A README file explaining the problem, approach, and learning outcomes

## Purpose
This repository is created for academic learning, skill development, and to demonstrate applied understanding of optimization techniques.
